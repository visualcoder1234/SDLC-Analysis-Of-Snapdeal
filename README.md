# SDLC Analysis of Snapdeal
## Repository Overview

This repository contains the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) analysis report
of the Snapdeal e-commerce platform. The objective of this repository is to understand
requirements evolution, documentation changes, and GitHub branching concepts.

## Repository Structure

- Initial Report:
  Contains the first version of the SDLC analysis before requirement validation updates.

- Final Report:
  Contains the revised version after incorporating improvements in requirements
  validation and comparison analysis.

## Branching Strategy

The main branch stores the initial version of the report.
A separate branch was created to make updates and improvements to the report.
After completing the revisions, the branch was merged back into the main branch.

This approach helps in understanding version control, document evolution, and
branching concepts without using source code.

## Purpose

This repository is created as part of an academic assignment to demonstrate:
- SDLC model comparison
- Requirements engineering documentation
- Version control using GitHub
